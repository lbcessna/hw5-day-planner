# hw5-day-planner
- Created infrastructure for hw5
- Moved index.html and style.css to folder.
- Accidentally added a package-lock.json. Not sure what that is; moving on.
- Added getDate function and appended to the header.
- Still working on getting colors to show. However, the times are there.



## Acceptance Criteria


GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- [X] WHEN I open the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- [X] WHEN I scroll down THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- [ ] WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- [ ] WHEN I click into a timeblock THEN I can enter an event
- [ ] WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
